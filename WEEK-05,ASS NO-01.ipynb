    "In Python, an **exception** is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a Python script encounters an error, it raises an exception. If the exception is not handled, it will terminate the program. Exceptions typically occur due to logical errors or invalid operations (like dividing by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, etc.).\n",

    "| **Exceptions** | **Syntax Errors** |\n",
    "| -------------- | ----------------- |\n",
    "| Exceptions occur during the execution of the program. They are runtime errors. | Syntax errors are errors in the code's structure, which occur before the program is executed (during parsing). |\n",
    "| Examples: Division by zero, file not found, invalid type conversions. | Examples: Missing colons, incorrect indentation, improper function definitions. |\n",
    "| Can be handled using `try` and `except` blocks, allowing the program to continue running. | Cannot be handled because the code won't run if there are syntax errors. |\n",

    "### Custom Exceptions in Python:\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that extend the built-in `Exception` class. They allow developers to create exceptions that are specific to the logic or needs of their application. These exceptions help improve the clarity and maintainability of the code by making the error messages more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Custom Exceptions?\n",
    "1. **Clarity and Context**: Built-in exceptions like `ValueError` or `TypeError` are general, and sometimes they don't give enough context about what went wrong in the application. Custom exceptions provide more descriptive error messages specific to the application's logic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Handling Specific Errors**: Custom exceptions allow you to handle unique error cases in your code more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintainability**: When you use custom exceptions, it becomes easier to debug, modify, and maintain the code because the error messages are descriptive and meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Create Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "To create a custom exception, you define a new class that inherits from Python’s built-in `Exception` class or any subclass of `Exception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Defining a custom exception class\n",
    "class InvalidAgeError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception raised when an invalid age is provided.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age, message=\"Age must be between 0 and 120\"):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function that checks age validity\n",
    "def check_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0 or age > 120:\n",
    "        # Raise custom exception if age is not valid\n",
    "        raise InvalidAgeError(age)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Age {age} is valid.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main program\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "    check_age(age)\n",
    "except InvalidAgeError as e:\n",
    "    # Catch the custom exception and display the error message\n",
    "    print(f\"InvalidAgeError: {e.age} is not a valid age. {e.message}\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    # Catch non-integer inputs\n",
    "    print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Program execution finished.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Exception Class** (`InvalidAgeError`):\n",
    "   - Inherits from `Exception` and adds custom logic to the error.\n",
    "   - Accepts `age` and a custom `message` to provide more context about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`check_age` Function**:\n",
    "   - Raises the `InvalidAgeError` if the `age` is not within the range 0-120.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, it prints a confirmation message if the age is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - The `try` block calls `check_age`, and if an invalid age is provided, the `InvalidAgeError` is raised and caught in the `except` block.\n",
    "   - There’s also an `except` block for handling `ValueError` in case the user enters non-integer input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "- **Case 1: Valid input**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter your age: 25\n",
    "  Age 25 is valid.\n",
    "  Program execution finished.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 2: Invalid age (e.g., `-5`)**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter your age: -5\n",
    "  InvalidAgeError: -5 is not a valid age. Age must be between 0 and 120\n",
    "  Program execution finished.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 3: Invalid input (e.g., `abc`)**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter your age: abc\n",
    "  Please enter a valid integer.\n",
    "  Program execution finished.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "- **Improved Readability**: The error message clearly indicates that an invalid age has been provided, making it easy to understand what went wrong.\n",
    "- **Specific Exception Handling**: The code can catch and handle this specific exception separately from other types of errors.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The custom exception can be reused throughout the codebase wherever age validation is required."

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Exception Class**: \n",
    "   - `NegativeNumberError` inherits from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "   - The class accepts the invalid `value` and a `message`, which are passed to the `Exception` class using `super()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`check_positive_number` Function**:\n",
    "   - Checks whether the number is negative.\n",
    "   - If the number is negative, it raises the `NegativeNumberError` with a custom message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - The `try` block calls `check_positive_number` and may raise the `NegativeNumberError` if a negative number is entered.\n",
    "   - The `except` block catches and handles the custom exception, displaying an appropriate error message.\n",
    "   - Another `except` block handles non-integer input using the `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 1: Positive number**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter a positive number: 5\n",
    "  The number 5 is positive and valid.\n",
    "  Program execution finished.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 2: Negative number**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter a positive number: -3\n",
    "  NegativeNumberError: -3 is invalid. Negative numbers are not allowed.\n",
    "  Program execution finished.\n",
